# React Basics Lesson

This project contains exercises to practice fundamental React concepts. Follow the instructions for each exercise precisely. The automated tests will check your work against these exact requirements.

## Exercises

### 1. Basic Components
- **Task 1.1**: Create a functional component named `Welcome` that returns a `<h1>` element with the text `"Welcome to React!"`.
- **Task 1.2**: Create a functional component named `UserCard` that accepts a prop `name` and returns a `<div>` containing an `<h2>` with the text `"User: [name]"` (replace `[name]` with the prop value).
- **Task 1.3**: Create a functional component named `Button` that accepts a prop `text` and returns a `<button>` element displaying that text.

### 2. Props and Data Flow
- **Task 2.1**: Create a functional component named `ProductInfo` that accepts props `name` and `price`, and returns a `<div>` containing an `<h3>` with the product name and a `<p>` with the text `"Price: $[price]"`.
- **Task 2.2**: Create a functional component named `StudentList` that accepts a prop `students` (array of strings) and returns a `<ul>` with each student name as an `<li>` element.

### 3. State with useState Hook
- **Task 3.1**: Create a functional component named `Counter` that uses `useState` to manage a count starting at 0. Return a `<div>` containing the count in a `<p>` element and a button with text "Increment" that increases the count by 1 when clicked.
- **Task 3.2**: Create a functional component named `TextInput` that uses `useState` to manage an input value. Return a `<div>` containing an `<input>` element and a `<p>` element that displays the current input value.
